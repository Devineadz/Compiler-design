# Compiler-design

A simple compiler project for a programming language created for a University course.

Parts:
- Table-driven lexical analyzer to extract tokens from the source file.
- Recursive descent predictive parser to check the validity of the structure and to create an abstract syntax tree using a stack.
- A visitor pattern to create symbol tables for the program.
- Tag based code generation.
